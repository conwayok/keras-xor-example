# keras-xor-example
This is a simple python script demonstrating basic deep learning with keras.

## Description
A XOR (exclusive-or) gate has inputs and outputs as follows:

|A|B|A XOR B|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

We use this as training data and try to train a XOR gate model.
